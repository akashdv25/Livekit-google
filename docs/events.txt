Overview
The LiveKit SDKs use events to communicate with the application changes that are taking place in the room.

There are two kinds of events, room events and participant events. Room events are emitted from the main Room object, reflecting any change in the room. Participant events are emitted from each Participant, when that specific participant has changed.

Room events are generally a superset of participant events. As you can see, some events are fired on both Room and Participant;
