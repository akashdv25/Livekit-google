Connecting to a LiveKit room (await ctx.connect()) where the audio/video streams happen.

Creating an Assistant agent with instructions on how to handle the conversation (polite, confirm details, end call on request, detect voicemail).

Setting up an AgentSession that connects:
STT (speech-to-text) using Deepgram
LLM (chat AI) using OpenAI GPT-4o
TTS (text-to-speech) using Cartesia
VAD (voice activity detection) using Silero

Noise cancellation

Starting the session on the connected room, listening to audio from the caller and responding via TTS.

Handling outbound calls if a phone number is provided in job metadata, creating a SIP participant via LiveKit API.

The agent can trigger actions like end_call() to hang up (by deleting the LiveKit room).
