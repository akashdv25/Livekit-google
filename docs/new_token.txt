Creating a token
https://docs.livekit.io/home/get-started/authentication/#creating-a-token

This token encodes the identity of a participant, name of the room, capabilities and permissions. Access tokens are JWT-based and signed with your API secret to prevent forgery.
refer this before creating a token

Access tokens also carry an expiration time, after which the server will reject connections with that token. Note: expiration time only impacts the initial connection, and not 
subsequent reconnects.

from livekit import api
import os

token = api.AccessToken(os.getenv('LIVEKIT_API_KEY'), os.getenv('LIVEKIT_API_SECRET')) \
    .with_identity("identity") \
    .with_name("name") \
    .with_grants(api.VideoGrants(
        room_join=True,
        room="my-room",
    )).to_jwt()


Updating permissions
A participant's permissions can be updated at any time, even after they've already connected. This is useful in applications where the participant's role could change during the session, such as in a participatory livestream.

It's possible to issue a token with canPublish: false initially, and then updating it to canPublish: true during the session. Permissions can be changed with the UpdateParticipant server API.
